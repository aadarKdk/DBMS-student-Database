# DBMS-student-Database
The DBMS-student-Database is a database management system project developed as part of the DBMS lab curriculum.\
By doing this project, we aimed to gain practical experience.

The DBMS-student-Database project provides us with a valuable learning experience in database design, creation, SQL query formulation, and database administration. This project equippes us with the necessary skills and knowledge to handle real-world database management challenges effectively.


The DBMS-student-Database project is a practical implementation of a database management system using PostgreSQL.
